# Creating Escape Rooms in QiskitBlocks

One of the ways that QiskitBlocks may be leveraged to teach quantum computing is with the use of *escape rooms*, arranged in a pedagogical sequence in a *level*. For example, Level I teaches some fundamental concepts of quantum circuits and gates, and Level II teaches how to create quantum logic gates and oracles. Other levels are currently being developed to teach additional quantum computing related concepts, so this document is intended to serve as a guide for those who would like to contribute a level of escape rooms.

## Setting up to create escape rooms

First, you'll need to [install and run QiskitBlocks](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/QiskitBlocks/blob/master/README.md). It will also be helpful to solve all of the circuit puzzles in the Level I & II escape rooms to get a feel for the style and incremental approach taken to teach quantum computing concepts. You can enter Level I using instructions in the game, and enter Level II by following the  sign after completing Level I. You may also teleport to the Portal Room, shown below, by jumping through an orange portal in any of the escape rooms. From the Portal Room you may enter various levels of escape rooms, noting that several are under construction or unavailable, as indicated by icons on the wall.
