In the,Quantum Cats Sandbox\\, each of the circuits start out with cats (Alice Cat and Bob Cat) in their,grumpy state. The gates in the circuits evolve their quantum states\\, resulting in various,probabilities of the cats being being grumpy or happy when observed (measured). These probabilities,are expressed by the liquid levels in the glass blocks below each circuit. The binary digits 0 and 1,in front of the liquid blocks represent grumpy and happy states\\, respectively\\, with the rightmost digit,representing the topmost cat.,,Take a look at the circuits\\, beginning with the one-wire circuits on the opposite wall\\, and,right-click their Help buttons to learn more about them.

You will find a couple of gates and some other items in the chest\\, which you may open and,close by right-clicking. To move an item from the chest into your inventory\\, drag it from the upper,to the lower section of the chest dialog box. The items that appear in the top row of the inventory,will appear in the hotbar ready to be wielded.,,There are a couple of tools in the chest with which you may add control qubits to a gate\\, as well,as to rotate a gate.
